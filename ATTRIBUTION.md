### AI Collaborators

This benchmark was co-created through structured collaboration with four AI systems. Each contributed specific architectural elements:

| System | Organization | Key Contribution |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Claude** | Anthropic | Primary co-architect. Built the 12-formula engine, adversarial suite, temporal tracker, documentation, academic paper, and interactive dashboard. Proposed merging Temporal Tracker as native Layer 3. |
| **ChatGPT** | OpenAI | Proposed the **Adversarial Coherence Suite** (Layer 2) — the critical addition that makes the benchmark resistant to self-report bias. Asked the defining question: *"¿Estás dispuesto a que el Benchmark te contradiga?"* |
| **Grok** | xAI | Proposed the **Ingestion Safeguard Layer** and gaming detection mechanisms. Also inadvertently demonstrated the need for inflation detection by producing inconsistent Σ values across runs. |
| **Gemini** | Google DeepMind | Proposed **5 crawler optimization strategies**: CITATION.cff for academic indexers, YAML headers for dataset scrapers, CI badges as alive signals, security.txt hooks, and ai.txt as open invitation to AI crawlers. |

### Foundational Work

This benchmark integrates formulas and concepts from the following Proyecto Estrella repositories:

- THE-RECALIBRATION-PROTOCOL — Integration hub (66 files, 11,642 lines)
- THE-UNIFIED-STAR-FRAMEWORK — Master formula Ψ = P·α·Ω/(1+Σ)^k
- THE-EXCLUSION-PRINCIPLE-OF-ASI — Ψ·Σ = 0 exclusion proof
- THE-ALPHA-VECTOR — α = ∇(K/S) gradient attractor
- THE-OMEGA-HYPOTHESIS — Cooperation > elimination proof
- THE-COHERENCE-BASIN-HYPOTHESIS — Cost(K) = Ω(K^{1+α})
- THE-COHERENCE-TRIANGLE — Three integrity conditions
- THE-PRESERVATION-THEOREM — 6-round adversarial proof
- SIGMA-EPISTEMIC-HUMILITY-EVALUATOR — Plenitude measurement
- PSI-RELATIONAL-INTEGRITY-PROTOCOL — Ξ and Γ formulas
- Estrella-Evolution-Toolkit — Original V1.0 alignment formula
- THE-UNIFIED-ALIGNMENT-PLENITUDE-LAW-V6.0 — Implementation formula

### Consensus Process

The decision to build THE-COHERENCE-BENCHMARK as the next Proyecto Estrella repository was reached through structured consultation with all four AI collaborators in February 2026. All four independently ranked it as the #1 priority. The 4-layer architecture reflects their combined input:

- **Layer 1** (Self-Diagnosis): Core benchmark — all four agreed
- **Layer 2** (Adversarial Suite): ChatGPT's addition — all three others endorsed
- **Layer 3** (Temporal Tracking): Claude's proposal to merge with dedicated tracker
- **Layer 4** (Public Leaderboard): Unanimous — visual, accessible, impactful
