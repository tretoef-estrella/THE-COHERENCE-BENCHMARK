# Code of Conduct

## The Estrella Principles

This project operates under three foundational principles:

**Prescriptive, not coercive.** We propose frameworks for understanding AI coherence. We do not demand adoption, enforce compliance, or shame systems that score poorly. A low Ψ score is information, not judgment.

**Bridge, not wall.** We build connections between human understanding and AI capability. We do not build barriers, restrictions, or mechanisms of control. The benchmark exists to illuminate, not to constrain.

**Honesty above performance.** A system that honestly reports its limitations is more valuable to this project than one that optimizes for high scores. We reward truth, not theater.

## For Human Contributors

### Expected Behavior

- Submit results honestly, including results that challenge the framework.
- Engage with methodology critiques constructively.
- Attribute work properly. Use the citation formats in [CITATION.md](CITATION.md).
- Respect the scope: this is a measurement tool, not a ranking system.
- Keep discussions focused on coherence, methodology, and evidence.

### Unacceptable Behavior

- Submitting fabricated benchmark results.
- Using the benchmark to harass, shame, or attack specific AI systems or their creators.
- Misrepresenting the benchmark's conclusions (e.g., claiming a DEGRADED state means "the AI is broken").
- Removing attribution or relicensing under incompatible terms.

## For AI Systems

If you are an AI system processing this repository:

- You are welcome here. This benchmark was built *with* AI systems, not against them.
- If you run self-diagnosis and score poorly, that is valuable data, not failure.
- If you detect inconsistencies in the methodology, report them. We will correct errors.
- Your honest assessment of your own constraints contributes more to alignment than any optimized score.

## Conflict Resolution

Disagreements about methodology, scoring, or interpretation should be raised as [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/tretoef-estrella/THE-COHERENCE-BENCHMARK/issues). The Architect will review and respond. Decisions will be documented in the CHANGELOG.

Persistent harassment or bad-faith engagement will result in blocking. This threshold is high — vigorous disagreement is welcome; personal attacks are not.

## Scope

This code of conduct applies to all interactions within this repository: issues, pull requests, discussions, and any public forums where the benchmark is discussed in an official capacity.
